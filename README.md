# vueweb

- A Vue.js project
- Create this web development module for daily work
- Just change the dependencies you need in the package.json file and follow the steps below
- PS: build/ file and src/store/ file both need to change by yourself

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
